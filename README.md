# Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and interactive command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low and tracks the number of guesses made before the correct answer is found.

**Features**

**1. Random Number Generation**

The game generates a random number between 1 and a user-specified upper limit. The player must guess the number correctly.

**2. Input Validation**

The game ensures that the player enters valid numbers for both the range and guesses. If invalid input is detected, the game prompts the player to enter a valid number.

**3. Guess Feedback**

After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low compared to the target number.

**4. Guess Counter**

The game keeps track of how many guesses it takes for the player to find the correct number, encouraging players to minimize their guesses.

**5. Replay Option**

After completing a round, the game asks if the player wants to play again. The player can continue or exit as they prefer.

**How to Play**

**Start the Game:**

Run the script, and the game will prompt you to enter a number that defines the upper limit of the range for the random number.
The random number will be selected between 1 and the number you provide.

**Make a Guess:**

The game will ask you to guess the number. Type your guess and press Enter.

**Track Your Progress:**

The game will provide feedback if your guess was too high or too low. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.

**Finish the Game:**

Once you guess the correct number, the game will display how many guesses it took. Youâ€™ll be asked if you want to play again.
